* Shadows
 -> add cascaded shadow maps?
 -> optimize by not drawing decals (unless clipping decal?)
 -> optimize by actually adding a shadow shader variant for each shader type to avoid fragment shader load for no reason (usually do nothing other than alpha testing where needed)
 -> optimize drawn lod for cascades? lods matching with gbuffer lods is good,
     but should at least avoid casting shadows where shadow resolution is low anyway
	 but need to be careful not to have low lod object shadows appearing on higher res lod
 -> add blurry shadows for distant casters?

TODO (aprox in order of importance):

> fix tracking cam (movement doesn't follow tracked space)

> Add actual tick system with interpolation
 
> Add vehicle with trailer for shits and giggles

  
> add glossy effect for sun, and point lights
   add glossyness to gbuffer
  especially windows should have strong reflections
> glossy effect should be skybox reflection, either render sky or use clouds skybox,
   but ideally one where we can slightly simulate the sun being behind the clouds 

add terrain clipping to roads
  
> Make point lights turn off at night
 -> do gradual turning off of lights, switch to a gpu driven drawing to allow lights to turn off without cpu interaction and actually stop being rendered
 -> maybe try out tiled lighting, but not sure how to handle variable length data structure yet

> Auto exposure system, with average light?
> Do bloom at the same time, since bloom requires downsizing lit buffer as well
  

> make cars slow in curves
 -> bezier can compute curvature, instead of exact, maybe only slow down in center of curve
  -> center can vary, but could approximate point of most curvature and simply aim to reach a speed based on curvature there, could also limit on whole curve or lerp between different samples

> A* instead of Dijkstra?
 -> does it make the code less flexible? probably not
 -> profile
 
> crosswalks (graphics)
> middle nodes
> end nodes

> swtich to bezier 4 for s curves, uturn etc.
 -> test if bezier 4 can emulate bezier 3 or if hybrid system is better
 -> Bezier4 is hard to get consistent with spacing Bezier3 seems to work using my intersection algorithm
     maybe use Bezier3 with 4 points (abc < .5 t , bcd > .5 t with [0, .5] as [0,1] range) ? would that even help?

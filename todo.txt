 Fixed deadlocks from blocked cars through blocked bool

TODO:
  
> Have a metric of traffic flow
  -> avg car speed vs speed limit?
  
> add heuristic for right before left
 -> how to avoid randomness when all for lanes have arriving cars?
 -> only apply before entering intersection (ziplock by first come first serve inside)
 
> add heuristic for prioritizing long waiting cars
   wait time > thres && wait time > other wait time * 2  or similar
 
 
 Turn SegLane pointers into lane pointers, where lane contains info about agents, reserved space, maybe cached bezier?
  -> how do I access the segment then?
  -> maybe just keep SegLane but make accessing lane directly more convinient
   -> and maybe turn SegLane into the (unique) lane* for hashing and comparisons, since it's slightly faster
  -> also lanes can be allocated directly after Segment itself to avoid vector
  
> Actually fix deadlocks
 -> 
 
> Add actual tick system with interpolation
 
> add 4 lane (main) streets
 -> could be complicated with how lanes have to be handled during pathfinding
 
> traffic lights for large intersections?

> make cars slow in curves
 -> bezier can compute curvature, instead of exact, maybe only slow down in center of curve
  -> center can vary, but could approximate point of most curvature and simply aim to reach a speed based on curvature there, could also limit on whole curve or lerp between different samples

> Add vehicle with trailer for shits and giggles

> A* instead of Dijkstra?
 -> does it make the code less flexible? probably not
 -> profile

> can do priority road as heuristic as well

 -> heuristic is just a number per car that determines when cars are swapped
 
 -> do we even need to swap/sort? can we simply have waiting (arrival) time as the primary heuristic (prio number), iterate pairs and yield lower prio cars
   -> probably not, since i'm not sure how to ensure prio stays higher for cars behind other cars
   -> during pair iteration always yield car behind and ignore prio?
   -> or clamp prio to be higher than car in front? -> could lead to blocked cars not being yielded for, which is probably good
 
 Turn SegLane pointers into lane pointers, where lane contains info about agents, reserved space, maybe cached bezier?
  -> how do I access the segment then?
  -> maybe just keep SegLane but make accessing lane directly more convinient
   -> and maybe turn SegLane into the (unique) lane* for hashing and comparisons, since it's slightly faster
  -> also lanes can be allocated directly after Segment itself to avoid vector
  
> Add actual tick system with interpolation
 
> add 4 lane (main) streets
 -> could be complicated with how lanes have to be handled during pathfinding
 
> traffic lights for large intersections?

> make cars slow in curves
 -> bezier can compute curvature, instead of exact, maybe only slow down in center of curve
  -> center can vary, but could approximate point of most curvature and simply aim to reach a speed based on curvature there, could also limit on whole curve or lerp between different samples

Todays Agenda:

===================== Actual Progress ==========================================

Lane selection
 -> keep track of next turn (next intersection where we don't go straight)
     then somehow use that to determine which lane should be on?
	 as in, forward scan for turn, select lane there (left/rightmost? based on turn)
	 then backwards scan to 'follow' this lane through straight travel -> need map in->out lanes
	 this should inform us if we want to switch lanes, then simply decide based on some rules at which intersection to actually switch lanes
-> implement configurable random lane switch chance
 -> measure how much never switching lanes (pick first one?) vs randomly switching with different chances
   -> switching 10-20% of the time probably is a lot better than old version
-> implement opportunistic lane switches onto less congested lanes? based on free slots or flow rate or combination?
-> implement correct turn lane selection over multiple segments as planned

Fix lane order to be left to right?, just sort lanes on load, consider what to do on ui edits

Remove InLane & OutLane arrays in node, not needed!

Traffic lights
 -> add props for traffic light poles etc.
 -> make them actually glow (emmisive with bloom?)
 -> add simple cycle logic

===================== Graphics, so not really progress =========================

!!!!!
create car roughness tex
!!!!!

*finish PBR impl, if it's kinda wip that's fine, but need performant code
 > Kinda done? shading is fast as fuck and env map resolve is kinda fast compared to the naiive one as well (<1ms)
  -> Could consider testing if it cant be queued with one frame delay, opengl probably doesn't have a async compute queue though, if it had, you could even update it every 2 frames etc.
 > IBL realtime env map + directional sun (with shadowmap) + numerous point lights are all working

Make shadows disableable, I want all resources to be deallocated in this case

Bloom?

===================== Nice to have =============================================
make imgui nicely configurable using custom sections?  

rework asset system to allow for individual reloading?
 -> possibly add flags to each asset to tell when it changed (through ui or json)
 -> actually make textures configurable inside json and have renderer load them on demand (most of them anyway)

add loading screen for texture and mesh loading?
 maybe come up with a simple threadpool job system for loading?
 
 
 
fix lodding for roads and props, add lods for vehicles, at least one low res lod?
 -> make lod level thresholds + (if last level should always get drawn or not) configurable per asset
   (lod func computes visible feature size based on projection (fov) and user configurable lod resolution (default 500-1000 vertical?))

add actual culling (based on chunks?)
 -> this should net resonable shadow rendering performance
